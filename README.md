# Network-Security-using-Proxy-Server
(A functional proxy server operational on a small scale)
Consider the situation where multiple users of an organization access the Web through the same server. Depending on the network’s Web connection, the increased number of requests can result in an overhead on main server. To overcome this issue, we introduce a proxy server which handles the requests on behalf of main server. Initially, when a user tries to access a certain Web page for the first time, registered within the domain of organization, the server refuses connection (it requires authentication). The server will forward, based on the URL, the request to the proxy server for authentication. Now, with the help of fast & reliable chat application, a secure listening port is assigned after validating the user’s credentials, stored in the organization’s database. The user is directed to a portal interface where this retrieved secured port is entered and after environment validation, the required Web page under the domain of organization is accessed by the user. If this series of actions is repeated over several to hundreds of users, the performance increase via reduced access time can a real benefit to the users on a network.
